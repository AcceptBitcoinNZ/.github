Normalise don't evangelise

This is the repo for the NZ pleb project to onboard merchants to accept Bitcoin

Main areas are;
1. Vitally important - Local meetup groups in every area and coordination between groups at the national level. Thanks to James@NZBitcoiners.org for a top notch job with this.
2. Friendly outgoing pleb volunteers who are able to talk to merchants at a local level and explain the non-bitcoin related benefits to accepting bitcoin
3. A (in development) non-custodial broker who is able to liquidate lightning BTC -> NZD instantly at a guaranteed price. Allowing merchants to accept bitcoin without having to go near the bitcoin!

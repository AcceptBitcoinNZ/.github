This is the repo for the NZ pleb project to onboard merchants to accept Bitcoin

"Normalise don't evangelise"

Main areas are;
1. Vitally important - Local meetup groups in every area and coordination between groups at the national level. Thanks to James@NZBitcoiners.org for a top notch job with this.
2. Friendly outgoing pleb volunteers who are able to talk to merchants at a local level and explain the benefits to accepting bitcoin from a merchant perspective. 
 * Another Payment rail, as backup at no additional cost
 * No payment fees (for the merchant)
 * No charge backs
 * Dedicated Bitcoiners who will go out of their way to use your service purely because you accept Bitcoin.
 * Eventually - risk free way of accepting bitcoin (Still in development)
3. A (in development) non-custodial broker who is able to liquidate lightning BTC -> NZD instantly at a guaranteed price. Allowing merchants to accept bitcoin without having to go near the bitcoin!

"Accept it and they will come"

This is the repo for the NZ pleb project to onboard merchants to accept Bitcoin. The crux of Accept Bitcoin is to trojan horse the bitcoin in there using the guize of practicality, and then let the merchant / customers orange pill themselves in their own time. This is based on the original idea by bridge2bitcoin.com

"Normalise don't evangelise"

Main areas are;
1. Vitally important - Local meetup groups in every area and coordination between groups at the national level. Thanks to James@NZBitcoiners.org and BitKiwi (https://twitter.com/Bitkiwi1) for a top notch job with this.
2. Friendly outgoing pleb volunteers who are able to talk to merchants at a local level and explain the benefits to accepting bitcoin from a merchant perspective. Help set the merchant up, how to use Bitcoin and the Lightning network, from a merchant and customer perspective.
 * Another Payment rail, as backup at no additional cost
 * No payment fees (for the merchant)
 * No charge backs
 * Dedicated Bitcoiners who will go out of their way to use your service purely because you accept Bitcoin.
 * Global network of travelling Bitcoiners who when enough merchants have signed up will come to the country and spend their Bitcoin.
 * Eventually - risk free way of accepting bitcoin (Still in development)
3. A (in development) non-custodial broker who is able to liquidate lightning BTC -> NZD instantly at a guaranteed price. Allowing merchants to accept bitcoin without having to go near the bitcoin!

"Accept it and they will come"

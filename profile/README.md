# NZ pleb project to onboard merchants to Accept Bitcoin. 

The crux of Accept Bitcoin is to facilitate the merchant adoption of Accepting Bitcoin by explaining the practicality and ease of use of accepting Bitcoin. Then let the merchant / customers orange pill themselves in their own time. This is based on the original idea by [bridge2bitcoin.com](bridge2bitcoin.com)

"Normalise don't evangelise" - Chris Bridge2Bitcoin

Main areas are;
1. Vitally important - Local meetup groups in every area and coordination between groups at the national level. Thanks to James@NZBitcoiners.org and [BitKiwi](https://twitter.com/Bitkiwi1) for a top notch job with this.
2. Friendly outgoing pleb volunteers who are able to talk to merchants at a local level and explain the benefits to accepting bitcoin from a merchant perspective. Help set the merchant up, how to use Bitcoin and the Lightning network, from a merchant and customer perspective.
 * Another Payment rail, as backup at minmal setup cost (android phone)
 * No payment fees (for the merchant)
 * No charge backs
 * Dedicated Bitcoiners who will go out of their way to use your service purely because you accept Bitcoin.
 * Added to [btcmap.org](https://btcmap.org) a global Bitcoin merchant map attracting customers nationwide and if critical mass achieved - globally
 * Global network of travelling Bitcoiners who when enough merchants have signed up will come to the country and spend their Bitcoin.
 * Eventually - risk free way of accepting bitcoin without touching the Bitcoin (Still in development)
3. A (in development) non-custodial broker who is able to liquidate lightning BTC -> NZD instantly at a guaranteed price. Allowing merchants to accept bitcoin without having to go near the bitcoin!

# How Can I help?

 * Every merchant you are about to make payment at ask "do you accept Bitcoin?"
 * Spend and replace your Bitcoin whenever possible, do not perpeutate FIAT further by using it any more than neccessary.
 * Print out the pamphlet that James@NZBitcoiners.org and distribute to interested merchants.

Who We need
 * Bitcoiners
 * Developers, 
 * Compliance / legal people, 
 * Accountant
 * Marketers
 * Volunteers to talk to merchants (potential for payment incentive for volunteers but needs to be figured out)
 
## How do we make money? (to pay for the perpetuation of the business)
 * Exchange takes a trade fee (~0.6%) + withdrawal fees
 * We take a 0.4% fee, funds are used to improve or increase services to Bitcoiners NZ wide

## Benefits to Bitcoiners / New Zealanders
 * Increased utility of Bitcoin nationwide.
 * More freedom of choice for payment options.
 * Cheaper transactions
 * Pay using your own favourite wallet or own infrastructure.
 * Increased international tourism from freedom loving Bitcoiners who love to spend with bitcoin accepting merchants.
 * Able to hold an use a currency that is inflating at a schedule specified by maths and not feelings.
 
## Risks
 * Lightning node liquidity management & risk
 * Exchange float at risk of exchange fraud / failure (mitigate by spreading risk)
